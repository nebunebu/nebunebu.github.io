    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Online I tend to go by either nebu or nebunebu, stylized in lowercases,
      depending on username availibility. I did a little write up on the name 
      <a href="writing/on_the_name.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2018, I completed an undergraduate degree in analytic philosophy.
      I earned a secondary major in the humanities - not the study of western
      civilization, but a build your own major program, where mine consisted primarily of
      courses that would have been toward an English major.
    </p>

      For roughly a year after graduating, I resold used books. In short, I would
      go to thrift stores and library sales and resell them online. It was a lot
      of fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Between doing that and up until the start of the pandemic, I worked as a
      substitute teacher.

      Roughly a year ago, I started learning to code. After college I had somewhat
      regretted not pursing a stem degree, and moreover not having had taken more
      math courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      On some job board, I saw an ad for one of those places that pay minumum wage
      to teach you to code and then contract you out to companies. It caught my
      attention.

      Researching it, everything I saw recommended against it saying that bootcamps,
      were preferable. So I started researching bootcamps. Rather than going to one,
      I decided to just learn with open curricula. Initially this was with App Academy
      Open's ruby curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not say I got to far with it - far enough to learn the basics of the ruby
      language, but not enough to develop rails apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that my interests have diverted to quite a few different places, and in the
      course of doing so, I have picked up the fundamentals of a few different languages.
